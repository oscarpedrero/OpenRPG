# New OpenRPG Agenda

> The OpenRPG team is convening and strategizing for the update of the OpenRPG mod to align with V Rising Update 1.0.

# OpenRPG Update for Gloomrot

> Following the release of Gloomrot by Stunlock Studios for V Rising, the original RPG mod became incompatible, requiring extensive code updates. Now, the OpenRPG mod is fully functional again, with all its features intact!

# By the community, for the community

> It was crucial for us to keep the code open source to ensure excellent support and provide other mod developers the opportunity to develop plugins for OpenRPG at any time. This project is free and open to everyone, created by the community for the community, and everyone is a part of the development!

# The Future of OpenRPG

> We will soon share our future plans for OpenRPG with you. Initially, our focus is on releasing a stable public version! There is a high likelihood that in the future, the OpenRPG mod will incorporate a user interface for a clean and easy-to-use experience!
